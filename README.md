DESCRIPTION

This is the webpage my students use in my piano class to learn to play the piano.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN

1. Optimized Layout [ X ]

        The main window is too big to simply contain the list of songs.  Level & song selection should be contained in the left-side nav.

2. Improved Navigation [ X ]

        The song lists should be relocated to be within the the Level headers in an accordion style menu within the left nav.  Alternatively, clicking a level button should load that list of songs as well as a back button to see the whole list of levels again.  This should not interfere with the displayed PDF.

3. Lazy Loading PDFs [ X ]

        Clicking on a song link should load the PDF into the main window.  This will mean converting the anchor tags into list items with data stored for the PDF and video URLs.

4. Single Dynamic Video Link & PDF Link [ X ]

        A single, unmoving link whose target changes to match the currently displayed song.  The vast majority of the songs are 1 page and the main window suffices.  But sometimes it's better to view the PDF externally.

5. Logo & Splash [   ]

        "Welcome to the HHS Piano Page" is not a header, it's a splash.  The header should be reduced to the upper left corner and replaced with a logo.  The initial screen should welcome the user.

6. Acknowledgments & Change Log [   ]

        I need to find a place to track the version and acknowledge the source of the materials.

7. Better Leveling [   ]

        Each level should contain fewer songs which are more targeted toward a particular skill to master.  This should result in many of the current Levels being broken into several, and more levels overall.
        Each song list should also start with a link to a video or diagram explaining that level's focus.

8. Modern Songs [   ]

        Kids will be enticed with more popular songs mixed in appropriately with the current, stale selections.

9. Responsive Design [   ]

        This page should be usable on tablets and mobiles.

10. User authentication and progress tracking. [   ]

        Kids skip songs all the time and hurt their progress by not following the sequence.  Creating a log in and forcing them in prescribed choices at each level of learning on an individual basis will prevent this lost time and also allow a bit more sense of discovery (as well as the excitement of "unlocking" new songs.)
