DESCRIPTION

This is the webpage my students use in my piano class to learn to play the piano.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN

1. Optimized Layout
        The main window is too big to simply contain the list of songs.  Level & song selection should be contained in the left-side nav.

2. Improved Navigation
        The song lists should be relocated to be within the the Level headers in an accordion style menu within the left nav.  Alternatively, clicking a level button should load that list of songs as well as a back button to see the whole list of levels again.  This should not interfere with the displayed PDF.

3. Lazy Loading PDFs
        Clicking on a song link should load the PDF into the main window.

4. Single Dynamic Video Link
        A single, unmoving link whose target changes to match the currently displayed song.

5. Logo & Splash
        "Welcome to the HHS Piano Page" is not a header, it's a splash.  The header should be reduced to the upper left corner and replaced with a logo.  The initial screen should welcome the user.

6. Responsive Design
        This page should be usable on tablets and mobiles.
