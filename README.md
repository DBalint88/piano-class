Short-Term Goals for development:

1. In-line lazy loading of PDFs upon title clicking.

1a. A redesign of the layout: either an accordion or two small columns for the level / song selection menu.  Condense header to the square above the menu.
3. A single, dynamic video link which updates to the correct YouTube link of whatever PDF is currently displayed.
4. Songs in each level list should be preceded by an introduction describing and demonstrating the main concepts, probably with an inline video.
5. More modern songs should be added to each level.

Long-Term Goals for development:

1. Personal log-in.
2. On-site tracking of progress.
3. More careful, responsive, prescribed tracking.  Students should be presented with 2-5 options of songs on their current level.  On the back end, I should be able to approve their selection and grant them access to the next level.
